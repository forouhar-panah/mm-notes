	These are the notes that I took while studing the Memory Management subsystem of Linux. When it comes to arch-specific details I only
	consider x86-64(sometimes I do mention certain 32-bit specific details). when I study a certain part of Linux, I will always choose
	the latest stable version. I will state the version of Linux when I'm taking these notes.

1.2. Memblock:
	memblock is used to manage and allocate memory at early boot before page allocator is ready. All memblock memory is freed by mem_init inside mm_core_init. 


1.2.1 e820__memblock_setup:
	
	this is the function that initializes memblock data structures using the bootloader-supplied e820 map.
